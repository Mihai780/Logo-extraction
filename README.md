# Logo-extraction
A Python script that takes a dataset of website domains and extracts their brand logos using services like Clearbit or Google Favicons. The objective is to achieve a successful extraction rate above 97%. Failed attempts are logged for further analysis, and domains are grouped by logo similarity using image hashing.
