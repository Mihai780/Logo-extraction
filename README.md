# Logo-extraction
A Python script that takes a dataset of website domains and extracts their brand logos using services like Clearbit or Google Favicons. The objective is to achieve a successful extraction rate above 97%. Failed attempts are logged for further analysis, and domains are grouped by logo similarity using image hashing.

My thought process went like this: After reading the dataset and noticing that the only column was about the domain, I immediately realized that I would need to extract the Logo for a site by only using the domain. I explored multiple services that extract brand logos and decided to test several APIs: Brandfetcher, Clearbit and Google Favicons, each with the percentages of finding the logo for each domain as 14%, 86% and then 92%. After some time a new idea hit me, why not combine two of them to reach the 97% threshold and after some research I found out that the APIs were not recognizing some domains beucase they weren't part of their internal brand datasets, so I tried the two most succesful ones to see if that percentage is met, and it was (the percentage rose to 97.65%).

To calculate those percentages I had to send a HTTP request for each domain and then verify if the request was a succes. If it did, I computed an MD5 hash of the image bytes. I chose to use hashes instead of raw image bytes becasue they are are much lighter in memory and faster to process.
